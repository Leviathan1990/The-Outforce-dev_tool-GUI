			    USAGE:
================================
*Extracting files from *.box archive:
------------------------------------------------
Just put the *.box archives to the program's
root folder.
In the program, select the "open archive option
to load the *. file. The content of the *.box file
will be loaded to the listbox. You can decide how
would you extract files: extract selected file
(only one file), or extract the whole content of a 
*.box archive file.
The files will be extracted to the ExtractedFiles
folder.
------------------------------------------------
*.box archive building:
You can make *.box archives with the *.box
builder tab, but still there's an unknown error
that will make your *.box file useless.
Will be fixed and implemented in the upcoming
updates...
------------------------------------------------
			Image inspector:
There's a built-in image viewer tool, that lets you
display images (.bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png) fileform
ats are supported. you can save every image
file in these formats. Also you can rotate them, 
set the size mode and save them.
Usage: 
after you loaded a *.box archive file in the list-
Box component, select an image file format
(mentioned above) and open the Image
Inspector tab...
================================
		   KNOWING ISSUES
------------------------------------------------
/Archive builder can only open (add) files from
the Developer tools folder
/Archive buider can only save in the same folder
that the Developer tools use.
/There's an unknown problem with the archive
builder, so the game won't read the *.box files
made by Developer tools (will be solved in the
next update)...
Filtered files (image files, oms/cfg files) can not
be displayed in OMS editor. Will be fixed in the
next update.
